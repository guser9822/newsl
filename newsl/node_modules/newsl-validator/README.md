# newsl-validator

This module is meant to validate some fields of a basic newsletter form. The idea behind this is that to apply a *validation criteria* to the value, that is a string, of the fields of the form. It  is provided a default validation for the this default fields :

* **Name**, which is validated with a regular expression that accept only characters and discard white space and @#?|!
* **Surname** , which is validated with a regular expression that accept only characters and discard @#?|!
* **Email**, which is validated with a regular expression that accept only example@domain.ext format.
* **Birth date**, which is validated with a regular expression that accept DD/MM/YYYY format.

# Installation

To use this module install it with :
```
npm install newsl-validator
```

# Usage

The module expose a single method called *validator* which return true or false after validating the field given in input, which is an object with these properties : 

```
var validatorModule = require('newsl-validator');

var nameField = {
	content : 'Alex',
	type : 'NAME'
}

var res = validatorModule.validator(nameField); //true

```

The property **type** is used to fire the default validation criteria and can be valued as :
```
NAME,SURNAME,EMAIL,BIRTH_DATE
```

If you wanna apply a custom criteria to a default field or a new field you can use the **criteria** property :

```
var validatorModule = require('newsl-validator');

surnameField = {
	content : 'Clinton',
	type : 'SURNAME',
	criteria : function(content){
		return /^[^0-9 @#?|!]+$/.test(content) && content.length < 2;
	}
}

var res = validatorModule.validator(nameField); //false

```
